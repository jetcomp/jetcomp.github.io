              headaches, too. Jet Computers delivers down-to-earth, affordable
              services to help you get the most from the devices in your home and

            </p>
            <p>
              Jet Computers is here to take care of all your technical needs.
              Whether your device greets you with popups, long loading times, no
              internet connectivity, a gray- or blue-screen of death, or nothing on
              the screen at all: we offer a service to ease your woes! We can assist
              you with everything from PCs and Macs to home networks and portable
              devices &mdash; just browse the list below to learn more about some
              of our most common services.

                  <h3>Cleaning and tune-up</h3>
                  <p>
                    This is our most basic maintenence service, but also one of our
                    most valuable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For a low flat rate of $39<sup><small>.99</small></sup>, we run
                    a battery of powerful junk, malware, and virus cleaning tools on
                    your machine. We follow this with a second stage of
                    custom-tailored cleaning and optimization to ensure your devices
                    achieve maximum performance and enjoy long, healthy lives.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In many cases, we get your devices back to you next-day. We even
                    stand by our work with a no-questions-asked 7 day guarantee. If
                    you think we could have done better, we&rsquo;ll take another
                    look for no extra charge!

                  <p>
                    If your troubles extend way beyond slowdowns, popups, or spam,
                    check out our virus and malware service below. For more or less
                    extreme situations, you may instead be interested in our
                    reinstallation or complete restoration services.

                  <h3>Virus and malware removal</h3>
                  <p>
                    Sometimes a device is beyond cluttered or infected, and needs
                    serious intensive care. For such occasions, we take a targeted,
                    surgical approach to eradicate any traces of viruses, trojans,
                    ransomware, and every nasty sort of bug in between.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If you have ever attempted to simply delete a virus, you have
                    probably run into situations where the virus returns all by
                    itself, the system starts experiencing errors, or both. Authors
                    of malicious software use every trick in the book to keep you
                    captive, and that&rsquo;s where Jet Computers comes in.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    By placing your system in total isolation, it becomes possible
                    to fight back against malware or other unwanted software without
                    giving it a chance to defend itself. After an infection has been
                    cleared up, we continue to closely monitor system activity until
                    we are convinced that the culprit is not lying in wait to once
                    again rear its ugly head next time you sit down to check your
                    email.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    If this sounds a little overkill, our basic cleaning (detailed
                    above) may be more your speed. In fact, many scary-looking
                    infections are not so tough after all, and we will never charge
                    you for additional procedures that you don't need.

                    Our installation services cost no more than a basic

                    and longevity from your freshly installed gadgets. If you need

                    Have you recently purchased or begun considering a new device or

                    Computers will ensure that every last precious byte is carefully
                    transferred to its new home.

                    Or, perhaps your collection of pictures and documents has simply
                    grown unwieldy and difficult to organize. We can effectively and
                    efficiently unclutter your important files from
                    &ldquo;C drive&rdquo; to &ldquo;OneDrive&rdquo; or anywhere else
                    they may be hiding.

                    When dealing with sensitive or private data, we keep our hands

                    gapping to prevent data leakage; and military-grade encryption
                    if the need arises to connect your device(s) to the network.

                    sensitive data in digital form with each passing day, it&rsquo;s

                    When conventional scanners, cleaners, and repair tools simply
                    will not do the trick; but your computer&rsquo;s contents are
                    too crucial to let go of, it may be time for Jet
                    Computers&rsquo; most thorough procedure.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In these extreme cases, we begin by methodically isolating each
                    problem area of the system so that we may analyze and solve one
                    small piece of the puzzle at a time.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Instead of deleting damaged files en masse or simply restoring
                    the system to a previous state, we repair critical  components
                    on a file-by-file basis so that you get your computer back
                    exactly the way you remember it&hellip; minus the undesired
                    behavior.

                    Not every conversation involving computers needs to be about
                    what&rsquo;s wrong with them. If you just want to show your
                    desktop or laptop a little love to keep it from fading into
                    obsolescence, ask Jet Computers which upgrades are right for
                    your machine. If you're thinking of buying new, have us pick out
                    the perfect parts for your needs &mdash; we&rsquo;ll even take
                    care of assembly and delivery if you like!

                  <p>
                    Not only can we help you to identify parts that are compatible
                    with your computer and with each other, but we take care to
                    determine if there are &mdash; or would be &mdash; any
                    bottlenecks between components.

                    We understand that choosing to upgrade or replace a computer can
